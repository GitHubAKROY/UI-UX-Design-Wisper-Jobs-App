Describtion:

Project: Wisper Jobs App

A Figma-prototype for a job listing & job-seeking platform called Wisper Jobs. The design is centered around simplifying the job search process, improving employer-candidate matching, and making the user experience smooth, efficient, and visually engaging.

Key Features / Components

Job Listings / Discovery
Users can browse through job listings: job titles, companies, short descriptions, and key info (location, type, etc.). Possibly with filtering and sorting (by remote vs on-site, salary range, job type, etc.).

Detailed Job View
When a job is selected: full description, responsibilities, qualifications, salary/rate, benefits, company information, location, and application options.

Search & Filter Functionality
Search bar, filters to narrow jobs by categories (industry, role), experience level, location, remote/hybrid, salary, etc.

User Profile (Candidates & Employers)
  ─ Candidate profile where users can upload/resume, set goals, manage job applications.
  ─ Employer side (if included) could include posting jobs, seeing applicants, company branding, etc.

Application Flow
Users are guided through applying to jobs: maybe uploading resume, cover letter, or filling out a digital application. Possibly tracking status of applications (applied, interviewed, offer, etc.).

Notifications / Alerts
Users receive job alerts or notifications for saved searches, companies, or new jobs matching their preferences.

Saved / Favorite Jobs
Ability to bookmark or save job postings for later review.

Onboarding / Welcome Flow
First-time user experience: setting up profile, selecting interests / preferred job types / locations, possibly suggesting jobs based on preferences.

Settings
Profile settings, privacy, notifications, app preferences, etc.

Visual / UI Style

Clean, professional look: careful use of typography for clarity (job titles, company names, etc.).

Use of icons and layout to distinguish sections (job summary, details, company info).

Consistent colour palette that conveys trust and professionalism.

Intuitive navigation between discovery, detail view, saved/jobs posted, profile.

Purpose & Goals

To design a job platform that makes seeking and listing jobs easier, clearer, and more responsive to user needs.

To reduce friction in applying for jobs and finding matching positions.

To build a UI/UX prototype that demonstrates ability to design complex multi-flow apps (search, view details, profile, apply).
